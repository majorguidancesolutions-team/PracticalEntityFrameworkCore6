## Instructions  

Use the code to work through the activities for each chapter. Note that often there is a starter and a finished version.  You can just review the finished version or you can use the starter files to pick up from the start of the activity.  

If you are working out of order, you may need to run some migrations and do a couple of quick setup operations to get the code to work.

All files assume you have SQL Server developer edition on your local machine and a working version of Visual Studio 2019 or newer.
